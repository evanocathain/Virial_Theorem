<b> Virial_Theorem </b>

This repository contains material on the famous Virial Theorem.

Lecture Notes

The lecture notes are suitable for \approx 3rd year undergraduates.

Derivation

The derivation of the more general version of the Virial Theorem is an
excerpt from my 'Part 3' essay on star formation - it is more suitable
for advanced undergraduates/beginning graduate students. For
expediency, the end result is simply quoted in the reference notes but
is included here for the interested reader.

Further Reading

A suggested list of references for further reading for anybody wanting
to delve a bit deeper is also provided.
